# Azure AI News RSS Feed
Quick and dirty RSS feed generator for the [Azure AI News page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/whats-new). 

- Runs once per day. 

- Feed available on:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conoro/azure-ai-news-rss-feed/refs/heads/main/rss.xml`

- Tested working on Feedly.

- Shows some empty headings which I must clean up at some stage.
